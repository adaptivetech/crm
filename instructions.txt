Here’s what’s required for the server to run the site:

- - PHP 7.1
- - composer
- - MySQL 5.6+

All the code in the linked tar.gz file is all they need + the database dump link.

Once ready to cut over to the new server, they just need to login to cloudflare and change the DNS for crm subdomain to the new IP. If you need a new database dump before going live, just let me know and I can send that over as well.
